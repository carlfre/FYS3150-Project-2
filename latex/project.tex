\maketitle 
    
\textit{https://github.com/carlfre/FYS3150-Project-2}
    
\section*{Problem 1}

Firstly, we want to show that given $\hat{x} \equiv x/L$ and $\lambda = \frac{FL^2}{\gamma}$, this equation

\[ \gamma \frac{d^2 u(x)}{dx^2} = -F u(x), \]
can be written as
\begin{equation}
\frac{d^2 u(\hat{x})}{d \hat{x}^2} = - \lambda u(\hat{x})
\label{eq:dimless}
\end{equation}

Let us start by replacing $x$ with $\hat{x}$. Since $\frac{d}{dx} = \frac{d \hat{x}}{dx} \frac{d}{d \hat{x}} = \frac{1}{L} \frac{d}{d \hat{x}}$, we get

\[ \gamma \frac{1}{L^2} \frac{d^2 u(\hat{x})}{d \hat{x}^2} = -F u(x) \]

If we now insert $F = \frac{\lambda \gamma}{L^2}$, we see that our final expression becomes

\begin{align*}
\gamma \frac{1}{L^2} \frac{d^2 u(\hat{x})}{d \hat{x}^2} &= -\frac{\lambda \gamma}{L^2} u(x) \\
\frac{d^2 u(\hat{x})}{d \hat{x}^2} &= - \lambda u(\hat{x}),
\end{align*}
which is the same as (\ref{eq:dimless}), as we wanted to show.

\section*{Problem 2}
Next, we want to show an important property of orthogonal transformations. Let us assume that we have a set of vectors $v_i$ that is orthonormal, in other words $v_i^T \cdot v_j = \delta_{ij}$, and that $U$ is an orthogonal matrix, i.e. that $U^T = U^{-1}$. Now, we want to show that the set of vectors $w_i = U v_i$ is also orthornormal. Saying that it is orthonormal is the same as saying that $w_i^T \cdot w_j = \delta_{ij}$. We insert our definition of $w_i$ into this, and get

\begin{align*}
\left(U v_i \right)^T \cdot (U v_j) = v_i^T U^T U v_j = v_i^T U^{-1} U v_j = v_i^T \cdot v_j
\end{align*}

This, we know is equal to $\delta_{ij}$, and thus we have proved the property.

\section*{Problem 3}

The code used to test this is in \lstinline{include/test.hpp} and \lstinline{src/test.cpp}, and can be run by running \lstinline{make test}. When done, it is evident that the analytical and Armadillo's \lstinline{eig_sym} give the same results, at least to a couple of decimals. In this test, we also used our Jacobi's rotation implementation implemented as a part of problem 5, and compared the results it gives.

\section*{Problem 4}

\subsection*{a)}
The \lstinline{max_offdiag_symmetric} function can be found in \lstinline{include/matrix_operations.hpp} and \lstinline{src/matrix_operations.cpp}.

\subsection*{b)}
Just like in problem 3, the code used to test this is in \lstinline{include/test.hpp} and \lstinline{src/test.cpp}, and can be run by running \lstinline{make test}. However, we used assertions to verify that everything works as it should, instead of printing it out and manually interpreting the results. If we had done everything again, we would have used this approach on problem 3 as well.

\section*{Problem 5}
The code used to implement Jacobi's rotation algorithm is in the function \lstinline{jacobi_rotate} in \lstinline{include/matrix_operations.hpp} and \lstinline{src/matrix_operations.cpp}. The tests discussed in part b of this problem was adressed above here, in problem 3.

\section*{Problem 6}
\subsection*{a)}
To find the number of transformations required, we use our previously implemented \lstinline{jacobi_rotate} function, and write the number of iterations used to file. We then use in \lstinline{src/plot.py} to plot it, and the results can be seen in figure \ref{fig:similarity}. If we fit a polynomial of degree $2$ to the data, we can see it fits perfectly.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.55]{plots/similarity.pdf}
    \caption{The number of similarity transformations required for different sizes of matrices, and a second order polynomial fit to the empirical data.}
    \label{fig:similarity}
\end{figure}

\subsection*{b)}
The Jacobi's rotation algorithm doesn't take advantage of the fact that the matrices in our problem are tridiagonal. After a couple of iterations on a large matrix, it will no longer be tridiagonal. This makes it reasonable to expect that it won't perform that much worse on a dense matrix than on a tridiagonal matrix like here.

\section*{Problem 7}
To solve this problem, we use all the components implemented, and assemble it in \lstinline{main.cpp}. We also have some new plotting code in \lstinline{src/plot.py} for this problem. Together, they make fig \ref{fig:solution10} and \ref{fig:solution100}. Notice the difference between the third subplots in the two plots. This just comes from the fact that if $v$ is an eigenvector, then $-v$ is also one.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.55]{plots/solution_for_N_equals10.pdf}
    \caption{Solutions for $N = 10$. The three different subplots show the normalised eigenvectors for different eigenvalues. This can be interpreted as the deflection of the beam under different ratios of force, quadratic length, and material properties.}
    \label{fig:solution10}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.55]{plots/solution_for_N_equals100.pdf}
    \caption{Solutions for $N = 100$. The three different subplots show the normalised eigenvectors for different eigenvalues. This can be interpreted as the deflection of the beam under different ratios of force, quadratic length, and material properties.}
    \label{fig:solution100}
\end{figure}


% \subsection*{Problem a}
% Write a solution for problem 1a here.

% \subsection*{Problem b}
% Write a solution for problem 1b here.

% \section*{Problem 2}
% We write equations using the LaTeX \texttt{equation} (or \texttt{align}) environments. Here is an equation with numbering
% \begin{equation}\label{eq:newton}
%     \vb{F} = \dv{\vb{p}}{t},
    % //tridiagonal.print();    //tridiagonal.print();% \end{equation}
% and here is one without numbering:
% \begin{equation*}
% \oint_C \vb{F}\cdot \dd \vb{r} = 0.
% \end{equation*}
% Sometimes it is useful to refer back to a previous equation, like we're demonstrating here for equation \ref{eq:newton}.

% We can include figures using the \texttt{figure} environment. Whenever we include a figure or table, we \textit{must} make sure to actually refer to it in the main text, e.g.\ something like this: ``In figure \ref{fig:rel_err} we show \ldots''. 
% \begin{figure}%[h!]
%     \centering %Centers the figure
%     \includegraphics[scale=0.55]{imgs/rel_err.pdf} %Imports the figure.
%     \caption{Write a descriptive caption here that explains the content of the figure. Note the font size for the axis labels and ticks --- the size should approximately match the document font size.}
%     \label{fig:rel_err}
% \end{figure}
% Also, note the LaTeX code we used to get correct quotation marks in the previous sentence. (Simply using the \texttt{"} key on your keyboard will give the wrong result.) Figures should preferably be vector graphics (e.g.\ a \texttt{.pdf} file) rather than raster graphics (e.g.\ a \texttt{.png} file).

% By the way, don't worry too much about where LaTeX decides to place your figures and tables --- LaTeX knows more than we do about proper document layout. As long as you label all your figures and tables and refer to them in the text, it's all good. Of course, in some cases it can be worth trying to force a specific placement, to avoid the figure/table appearing many pages away from the main text discussing it, but this isn't something you should spend time on until the very end of the writing process.


% Next up is a table, created using the \texttt{table} and \texttt{tabular} environments. We refer to it by table \ref{tab:output_table}.
% \begin{table}%[h!]
%     \centering
%     \begin{tabular}{c@{\hspace{1cm}} c}
%         \hline
%         Number of points & Output \\
%         \hline
%         10 &  0.3086\\
%         100 &  0.2550\\
%         \hline
%     \end{tabular}\caption{Write a descriptive caption here, explaining the content of your table.}\label{tab:output_table}
% \end{table}

% Finally, we can list algorithms by using the \texttt{algorithm} environment, as demonstrated here for algorithm \ref{algo:midpoint_rule}.
% \begin{algorithm}[H]
%     \caption{Some algorithm}\label{algo:midpoint_rule}
%     \begin{algorithmic}
%         \State Some maths, e.g $f(x) = x^2$.  \Comment{Here's a comment}
%         \For{$i = 0, 1, ..., n-1$}
%         \State Do something here 
%         \EndFor
%         \While{Some condition}
%         \State Do something more here 
%         \EndWhile
%         \State Maybe even some more math here, e.g $\int_0^1 f(x) \dd x$
%     \end{algorithmic}
% \end{algorithm}
